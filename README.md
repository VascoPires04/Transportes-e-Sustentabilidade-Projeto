# Transport-and-Sustainability-Project

This repository contains all the code used for the completion of the project for the Transport and Sustainability course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

To obtain the emission values, the programs should be run in the following order:

1. Run `survey.py` (which assigns a profile to each user).

2. Run `descriptive_statistics.py` (generates a .txt file with user statistics based on the survey questions).

3. Run files like `"Gas".py` to obtain the respective emission factors.

4. Run the `"emissoes_Gas_peak/off_peak".py` files to obtain the final results for emissions per gas.

5. To generate the graph of emissions, run `graph_emissions.py`.

6. **Note**: To obtain only the shift matrices, run the emission program for the gas "CO2e".
